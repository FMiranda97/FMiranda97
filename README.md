## About me

I started coding when I was 15 on a TI-84 calculator which I would use to create auto solvers for math and physics problems in highschool. Then I moved on to learning Visual Basic and C# and creating very basic games for fun. By the time I was 17 I joined college for a Mechanical Engineering course, but the only classes I actually liked were programming ones, so by the end of the year I changed to an Informatics Engineering course. 

Over the years Iâ€™ve studied many varied topics in college with the most interesting ones being compilers, distributed systems, data analysis, machine learning, evolutionary computation, business intelligence and data warehousing. Furthermore, I am constantly independently studying and have knowledge on architectural patterns, message based integration, microservices, DevOps (Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Git) and serverless development (AWS). I am also happy to simply learn new languages and frameworks, and while my main languages are Python and JavaScript, Iâ€™ve learned others such as Java, C#, Golang and PHP.


## My Projects
Here you can see a few projects I've worked on, most projects are just useless apps I've built to learn technologies, others you may find useful. I'll try to dockerize most of them so you can check them out by running very simple commands. As they are ready, I'll add them to this list:
 - ShiftAppensGame - Challenge Manager for Events - Vue + Express + MongoDB - https://github.com/FMiranda97/ShiftAppensGame
 - UniCloud - Study materials sharing website for FCTUC - Laravel + MySQL - https://github.com/Rita00/UniCloud
 - NerdScape - Single player game with leaderboards - PHP + JavaScript + MySQL - https://github.com/FMiranda97/NerdScape
